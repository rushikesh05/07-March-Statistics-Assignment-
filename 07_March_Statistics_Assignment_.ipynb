For example, if we have a dataset of ages of people in a family: 20, 30, 45, 50, 55. The range would be the difference between the highest age and the lowest age, which is 55 - 20 = 35.

To calculate the variance, we first calculate the difference between each data point and the mean, square those differences, and then take the average of the squared differences. The variance of this dataset is ((50-64)^2 + (60-64)^2 + (65-64)^2 + (70-64)^2 + (75-64)^2)/5 = 122.4. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which is sqrt(122.4) = 11.06.
